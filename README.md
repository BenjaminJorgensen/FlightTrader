# FlightTrader
FlightTrader is a trading algorithm proof of concept that attempts to
predict the direction of various American airline stocks using live data
about the airline

## Here's the Plan
1. Get a sample recurrent Neural Network running on the sample climate data
2. Modify that code so that it's trained on Airline data
3. Find and write a program that gets API data from airlines and feeds it into the file/model
4. Predict the direction of stock projected 1 week ahead.
5. Execute a trading program with rules for trading based on the results from
   multiple of these models
